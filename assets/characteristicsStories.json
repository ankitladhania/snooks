    "Funny Laugh": "Burts of joyful noise comes from the bottom of their belly. Filling the air with the purest form of joy. Contagious and infectious laughter.",
    "Loudest Burps/Farts": "Shaking the room with their gas. Boom boom boom. They always blame the person next to them.",
    "Best Dancer": "Twirling, swirling, gliding, moving. Music moves them to create movement. If on the dance floor or center stage they command the room.",
    "Loud Snorer": "ZZZZZZZZZZ. Almost like a vacuum cleaning is rev rev reving.  They could shake the walls with the deepest sleep."
